  ourStory: "In November 2015, we started Maa Ki Rasoi with a dream to serve North Indian food that feels just like home — simple, soulful, and full of love. The start was challenging, but with dedication and consistency, we won people over—not just with taste, but with the comfort and nostalgia our food brought. What started as a small step has now become a trusted name, known for serving food that truly feels like home. #GHAR KA KHANA",
